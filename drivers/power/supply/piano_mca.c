 * Xiaomi "MCA" ADSP charger/battery property transport (Xiaomi Pad 8 Pro)
 *
 * The piano ADSP firmware does not speak the standard Qualcomm battmgr
 * protocol.  It exposes the charger ICs and the ADC of the sub-PMIC as a flat
 * property space on the PMIC_RTR_ADSP_APPS glink channel, owner 0x800a (the
 * same owner battmgr uses), with a request/response format of its own:
 *
 *   request  { owner, type = 1, opcode (1 = read, 2 = write), property, seq,
 *              data[256] }
 *   response { owner, type = 1, opcode, property, retcode, seq, data[256] }
 *
 * Property ids are 32 bits wide; bits 31:16 select a class (0: charger and
 * battery, 1: wireless, 2: USB and PD).
 *
 * This driver replaces qcom_battmgr on this board.  By default only reads
 * are issued and charging limits stay with the ADSP firmware defaults (float
 * voltage 4350 mV, charge current 3000 mA, JEITA window 0-55 degC).  With
 * charge_policy=1 it raises the input current limit by charger type, with
 * charge_current=1 as well the charge current, and with hv_charge=1 it asks
 * PD and PPS sources for 9 V, and with cp_charge=1 as well it charges
 * through the SC8541 switched-capacitor stage from PPS sources; with
 * mipps_auth=1 it relays the Xiaomi charger authentication (MiPPS) messages
 * for userspace.  piano_mca_write_allowed()
 * lists every property it can write.  With pan_ack=1 it also acknowledges
 * the ADSP's USB-C port notifications.  The battery itself
 * is reported by the two bq27z561 fuel gauges; this driver adds the USB
 * input (presence from the bus voltage, bus current, input current limit and
 * the charger type detected by the ADSP).
